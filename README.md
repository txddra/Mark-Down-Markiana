#### Before we begin, I would like everyone to know a few things:
1. This ~~assignment~~ project took me longer to work on than I'm happy to admit.
2.  This is **NOT** my best work. I will `constantly` and `consistently` improve.
3.  Okay, so maybe I didn't need this third one but here it is,   so let's rock.
